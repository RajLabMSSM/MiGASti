## Omics analysis for cultured and stimulated microglia 

> This repository includes code and plots. Exploratory analysis and intermediate processing files are too large for this repository. 

 1. [QC](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/MiGASti/QC.html) plots. Quality control of all samples.
 
2.Exploratory Analysis: 
 - [Exploratory plots before filters](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/MiGASti/02092021_PCA_heatmap.html). PCA's, heatmaps with linear regression between the first 10 PCs and covariates with (533 samples) and without (483 samples) uncultured samples.
 - [Exploratory plots after filters](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/MiGASti/02102021_PCAs_afterfiltering.html). PCA's, heatmaps with linear regression between the first 20 PCs with (496 samples) and without uncultured (455 samples) samples.  
 
3. [Variance partition](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/MiGASti/Variance_partition.html) 

4.[Expression of stimulated specific markers](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/MiGASti/Markers.html) genes for 496 samples.
